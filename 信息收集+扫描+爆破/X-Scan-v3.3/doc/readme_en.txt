
X-Scan-v3.3 User Manual


1. System requirement: Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003


2. Introduction:

     X-Scan is a general network vulnerabilities scanner for scanning network vulnerabilities for specific IP address scope or stand-alone computer by multi-threading method, plug-ins are supportable. Which X-Scan feature include in the following: service type, remote OS type and version detection, weak user/password pair, and all of the nessus attack scripts combination. For the most known vulnerabilities, the corresponding descriptions and solutions are provided. As to other vulnerabilities, please refer to "Document" and "Vulnerability engine" in www.xfocus.org.
     We provided a simple SDK in X-Scan 3.0 for the purpose of friends can develop plug-ins conveniently. Everyone can download the source code of "nasl for windows", X-Scan plug-in SDK and the sample plug-in code from this link: "http://www.xfocus.net/projects/X-Scan/index.html".

4. Preparation:

    X-Scan which is absolutely free can be executed immediately after being decompressed without registration and installation (install WinPCap v3.1 beta4 automatically).


5. GUI program options description:
    
    "Scan range":
    
      "IP address range" - You can input a large range of IP section or a single IP address or domain name, and you can input the range of IP address that be separated by "-" or "," also, for example: "192.168.0.1-20,192.168.1.10-192.168.1.254,192.168.2.1/24". 
    
      "Load host list from file" - If this checkbox is checked, X-Scan will read target address from a text file. The file should contain a single address or range of address like the "IP address range" in each line.

    "Global options":
    
      "Modules" - Select the plug-ins what you want to use.
      "Parallel scanning" - Set the maximal number of parallel host and thread.
      "Network" - Select your network interface.
      "Report" - The final report file what located in the directory "log", support TXT, HTML and XML format currently.
      "Others":
        "Skip host when failed to get response" - If this checkbox is checked, target will be skiped with no response by "ICMP Ping" and "TCP Ping" before scanning.
        "Scan always" - Such as the caption.
        "Skip host when no open port has been found" - If X-Scan can't find any TCP port within the "Scan port", X-Scan will cancel the scan action.

    "Plug-in options":
      You can set the options of every plug-in in this module.


6. Frequently asked questions:

    Q: Does X-Scan work exactly without WinPCap?
    A: If the WinPCap driver hasn't been installed in your system, X-Scan will install WinPCap 3.1 beta4 automatically, otherwise X-Scan use the current version of WinPCap driver.

    Q: I can find 10 "checkhost.exe" in my task list when  I'm checking a subnet, why?
    A: X-Scan will create sub-process for every host. The sub-processes will terminate automatically after scanning. You can specify this number by parameter "-t".
    
    Q: Why did my computer rebooted when X-Scan was working?
    A: WinPcap does not work well if a firewall is installed on the same machine. You should disable or uninstall the firewall and try again.

    Q: Why did X-Scan identify target OS incorrectly?
    A: If target filtered NETBIOS and SNMP protocol and has strange TCP/IP stack fingerprinter, X-Scan can't identify it's OS correctly, you should judged by yourself.
    
    Q: Why did I selected the "SYN" method to scan TCP port but X-Scan used "TCP" method actually?
    A: Only under Windows 2000, SYN scan and the ability of identifing target OS passively are available, the permission of administrator is required simultaneously.

    Q: Dose the plug-ins of X-Scan 2.3 is compatible with X-Scan 3.0?
    A: No, X-Scan 3.0 changed the plug-in interface for the purpose of friends can develop plug-ins conveniently. So the old plug-ins need some modification.
    
    Q: How can I check the weak password with added password?
    A: Dictionary shipped with X-Scan is a simple demo. The better is used your own dictonary.

    Q: How can I install X-Scan to my system, and how can I register it?
    A: X-Scan which is absolutely free can be executed immediately after being decompressed without registration and installation (install WinPCap 3.1 beta4 automatically).
