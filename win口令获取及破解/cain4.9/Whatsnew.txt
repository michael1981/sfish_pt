- Bug in VNC sniffer filter (FIXED) 
- Numbers in the Crackers Tree (ADDED)


==================
Version 2.5 beta41
==================
NEW FEATURES:
- LM Hashes Cryptanalysis via Sorted Rainbow Tables (ADDED)
Cain can now perform cryptanalysis attacks on LM Hashes using RainbowCracks's 
sorted tables. This kind of attack is pretty fast but works only on LM Hashes 
not encrypted with a challenge. For informations on Rainbow Tables generation
and sorting please read the RainbowCrack's Tutorial 
(http://www.antsight.com/zsl/rainbowcrack/rcracktutorial.htm) 
VARIANT AND FIXES:
- Some bugs in the LM&NTLM Cracker (FIXED)


==================
Version 2.5 beta40
==================
VARIANT AND FIXES:
- Crashes parsing truncated HTTP packets (FIXED) 


==================
Version 2.5 beta39
==================
NEW FEATURES:

VARIANT AND FIXES:
- Some bugs in the LM&NTLM Cracker(FIXED)
- Bug fixed in Cain's HTTP parser  (FIXED)
- OpenSSL library upgrade to version 0.9.7c


==================
Version 2.5 beta38
==================
- Cisco Config Uploader (ADDED)
Cain can now upload configuration files to Cisco routers and switches that 
supports the OLD-CISCO-SYSTEM-MIB. The device configuration request is made 
via SNMPv1 using the Read/Write community string (the Read-Only one is not enough). 
The device will download its configuration from Cain using TFTP protocol. 
This feature will not work if there are network restrictions like ACLs or firewall 
rules on those protocols. The transfer is initiated by the device itself so dynamic 
NAT between you and the device is a problem too.


==================
Version 2.5 beta37
==================
VARIANT AND FIXES:
- OUI List (UPDATED)
- Duplicate entries in the APR list (FIXED)
- Winpcap library updated to version 3.0.1a (ADDED)
- Check for local Administrator's rights (ADDED)
- Better Error handling in network functions (ADDED)


==================
Version 2.5 beta36
==================
NEW FEATURES:
- NTLM Session Security Password Cracker

The long awaited cracker for NTLM Session Security authentications is 
finally available in this version. Now, all kind of LM, NTLM and NTLMv2 
Hashes with or without NTLMSSP encapsulation are supported and can be 
"Sent to the Cracker" for Dictionary and Brute-Force attacks.


==================
Version 2.5 beta35
==================
NEW FEATURES:
- IKE Aggressive Mode Pre-Shared Keys Cracker (ADDED) 
The cracker works with both MD5 and SHA1 Hashes.

- Sniffer filter for IKE Aggressive Mode Pre-Shared Keys authentications (ADDED)
The sniffer collects all the parameters needed to crack a Pre-Shared Key used in 
IKE Aggressive Mode authentications (see RFC-2409 for details).

The sniffer/cracker has been successfully tested using a Cisco VPN Client v4.0 
and a Cisco PIX Firewall Version 6.3(1). Please let me know your results.



==================
Version 2.5 beta34
==================
NEW FEATURES:
- Cisco Config Downloader (ADDED)
This feature lets you download the configuration file from Cisco routers
and switches that supports the OLD-CISCO-SYSTEM-MIB or the new CISCO-CONFIG-COPY-MIB.
(It seems that the Cisco PIX Firewall does not support this feature)
The device configuration request is made via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 using the Read/Write 
community string (the read-only is not enough). The device will upload its configuration 
to Cain using TFTP protocol. This feature will not work if there are network restrictions
like ACLs or firewall rules on those protocols. The transfer is initiated by the device 
itself so dynamic NAT between you and the device is a problem too.
VARIANT AND FIXES:
- "Cannot open the session file" problem in Telnet List (FIXED)


==================
Version 2.5 beta33
==================

The collector automatically grabs certificates from HTTPS servers and creates
a fake copy of them locally. All fake certificate's parameters except for public 
keys are the same as in originals.

- HTTPS Man-in-the-Middle Sniffer and password collector (ADDED)
Cain's HTTPS sniffer works in in FULL-DUPLEX-MODE processing both Client and 
Server HTTPS traffic. It makes use of APR (Arp Poison Routing) so the attacker's 
IP and MAC addresses can be totally spoofed client-side. The sniffer cannot 
decrypt HTTPS traffic if directed to/from the attacker's workstation.

- Sniffer filter for ICQ authentications (ADDED)

VARIANT AND FIXES:
- ICMP Traceroute always ask "Please enter a positive integer" (FIXED)
- Some problems in HTTP sniffer filters (FIXED)


==================

==================
Version 2.5 beta27
==================
NEW FEATURES:
- LSA Secrets Dumper (ADDED)
Cain can now dump LSA Secrets indirectly from the registry. The dumper uses  
LSASS code injection technique so you need Administrator privileges.

A RADIUS Key is a shared secret between the RADIUS server and 
a NAS(Network Access Server) used to encrypt RADIUS User's passwords. 
The cracker extracts Authenticators fields from Access-Request and 
Access-Accept packets and use them to recover these keys. 
Once the right key is found all User's passwords can be recovered instantly.
- RADIUS User's Passwords Sniffer/Decoder (ADDED)
Capture and decrypt RADIUS user's passwords once the NAS Shared Key is found.
- Sniffer filter for MSN authentications (ADDED)

==================
Version 2.5 beta21
==================
NEW FEATURES:

- SSH-1 Sniffer for APR (ADDED). 
Cain's SSH-1 sniffer works in in FULL-DUPLEX-MODE processing both Client and 
Server SSH-1 traffic. It makes use of APR (Arp Poison Routing) so the attacker's 
IP and MAC addresses can be totally spoofed and never exposed on the network. 
APR (ARP Poison Routing) and a Man-in-the-Middle situation is also required 
because of the RSA asymmetric encryption used in SSH-1 negotiation's phase. 
The sniffer supports 3 symmetric encryption algorithms: DES, 3DES and Blowfish. 
Zlib compression is not supported in this version. The sniffer cannot decrypt 
SSH-1 traffic if directed to/from the attacker's workstation.

- RSA SecurID Token Calculator (ADDED). 
The calculator produces valid tokens given the serial number and the activation 
key of an RSA SecurID device. These parameters are found in Token's activation 
files typically named "something.ASC".

- Promiscuous-Mode Scanner (ADDED). 
The scanner has been included in the main "Hosts List". It tries various tests 
based on non-standard ARP packets and it uses the same Spoofing configuration 
of APR. 

VARIANTS AND FIXES:
- New Cain's Traceroute GUI
- Minor bug-fixing
- Only one instance of Cain forced to run at a time
- "Couldn't create session file" error in Telnet Sniffer (FIXED)
- Export function in Host List (ADDED)
- Export function in PWL Cached resources Viewer (ADDED)
- Export function in Protected Storage Passwords Viewer (ADDED)

==================
NEW FEATURES:
- Sniffer filter for NTLMv2 authentication (ADDED)
- Sniffer filter for NTLMSSP (LM & NTLMv1, NTLMv1 only, NTLMv2) authentications (ADDED)
- NTLMv2 Password Cracker (ADDED)

****************************************************************************************
************************************ WARNING!!!! ***************************************
****************************************************************************************
In NTLMv2 authentication the Domain/Hostname name is also used; for this
reason the following commands: 
	"net use \\SERVER\C$ /user:administrator password"
	"net use \\SERVER\C$ /user:DOMAIN\administrator password"
produce different NTLMv2 encrypted passwords. With the first command Windows encrypts 
the NTLMv2 password using Domain = NULL. With the second command Windows encrypts 
the NTLMv2 password using Domain = "DOMAIN".

To avoid checking the password twice, the cracker always use the Domain/Hostname
in the "Domain" column of the list. This name is extracted from the authentication 
packet sniffed on the network.

If you already known the password and the NTLMv2 cracker does not retrieve 
it correctly try as follows: 
0) Quit Cain
1) modify the line in the file NTLMv2.LST in the programs directory deleting the 
Domain/Hostname:
EXAMPLE: Contents of NTLMv2.LST
original -> Administrator;DOMAIN;;C0A9FBDBD59A919E3E6812AF92CB338F;...........
modified -> Administrator;;;C0A9FBDBD59A919E3E6812AF92CB338F;.................
2) Restart Cain and test the password again

However, if you send to the cracker NTLMv2 hashes captured from a "good" session 
(a session with the "Successful" string in the LogonResult column) the cracker 
should work correctly.
